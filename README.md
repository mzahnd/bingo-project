# Bingo Project

This is my very first software project with a real life application!

Before this project all I've developed were (extremely) simple webpages, .NET (using Visual Basic) and BASIC 
applications with no other purpose but joy and learning.

A friend of mine needed a custom Bingo board that he could show through a projector while keeping another
window in his machine for using the software. I knew a little bit of Visual Basic .NET, so I built this 
application for him.

It was largely a success in every possible way. He was pretty satisfied with the end result and I have ended with
a completely new and exciting experience.

Skimming through the code nowadays, I realise how many my English mistakes were back then (notice I changed the 
non-existing word *Proyect* by *Project* somewhere in the middle), how much can actually be done by copying and
pasting lots of code (because, well, that's what I did.) and how much spaghetti code one can create.

This is posted with no prior modification to the original source code I wrote back in 2016 and is meant to be 
kept like that. Original.

> Note: It's written in Spanish. I had plans to continue developement with an English version but I never did it.
